[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I will be joining Georgia Institute of Technology, GA (Georgia Tech) this fall as a Graduate student in Cybersecurity and Privacy. Currently, I am a senior year ECE undergrad with a minor in computing at Manipal Institute of Technology, India. I am currently working as a research intern at the IMDEA Software Institute, Spain as part of my bachelor thesis, supervised by Dr. Juan Caballero and Dr. Srdjan Matic.\nMy research interests lie broadly in computer security and privacy. Some areas that particularly interest me are network, mobile, and web security and privacy, fingerprinting, and intrusion detection. Currently, I am exploring detection and mitigation of browser fingerprinting techniques.\nOutside research, I am also interested in application security (appsec) - penetration testing, full stack web development and cross-platform mobile app development.\nPreviously, I have worked on:\n Custom Deployable Production Honeypot with Visualisation Dashboard with Prof. Justin Pelletier and Prof. Bill Stackpole @ RIT. ReconAID : Reconnaissance Automation Framework @ C3i Center, IIT Kanpur.  I am always up for collaborations, so if you want to discuss projects that I have worked on or a potential collaboration, feel free to drop a mail.\nReach me at base64decode(a2FydGhpa3JhbWFrcmlzaG5hbjE0QGdtYWlsLmNvbQ==)\n","date":1640044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1640044800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://l3thal14.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I will be joining Georgia Institute of Technology, GA (Georgia Tech) this fall as a Graduate student in Cybersecurity and Privacy.
